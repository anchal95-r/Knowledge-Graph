# Knowledge-Graph
Key Features of a Knowledge Graph:
Semantic Understanding – Knowledge Graphs embed meaning into data using structured relationships.
Inference & Reasoning – They allow for logical deductions based on existing relationships.
Scalability & Flexibility – They can grow dynamically as new data and relationships are introduced.
Interoperability – Many Knowledge Graphs are built using ontologies and standards like RDF (Resource Description Framework) and OWL (Web Ontology Language).
Applications of Knowledge Graphs:
Search Engines (e.g., Google Knowledge Graph)
Recommendation Systems
Biomedical Research
Finance & Fraud Detection
AI and Natural Language Processing
Would you like me to expand on any of these areas, such as building a Knowledge Graph using a particular tool or applying it to a specific domain?
